Simple multiple screen auto brightness written in Delphi (any XE and later should be supported)<br>
demo (debug version) was compiled using XE11.

Based on

1) BlackOut is a multi-monitor screen dimmer application.<br>
https://github.com/bruceburge/BlackOut<br>
(c#) Very good but... not automation...<br>
[Problem] Screen shot affected...

2) Adaptive screen brightness/temperature for Windows, Linux, FreeBSD<br>
https://github.com/Fushko/gammy<br>
(c++) Very good but...<br>
[Problem] Primary monitor only... and crash on screen setting changed...

3) Desktop Duplication API<br>
https://github.com/tothpaul/Delphi/tree/master/DesktopDuplicationAPI<br>
(delphi) code was mainly copied from this.
